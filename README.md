# Ideation
Since we don't know yet what exactly should be built within the realm of autonomous agents. This repository does and will not contain any code. It just serves as a starting point to create, discuss and refine features to a degree that they can be moved into their own repositories.

The GitHub issues outline the essential features for each aspect of an AI agent, allowing the software developers to work on each feature independently while building the minimal viable product for the donation-driven business model around custom agent developmen based on user requests.
