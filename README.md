# Ideation
Since we don't know yet what exactly should be built within the realm of autonomous agents. This repository does and will not contain any code. It just serves as a starting point to create, discuss and refine features to a degree that they can be moved into their own repositories.

The GitHub issues outline the essential features for each aspect of an AI agent, allowing the software developers to work on each feature independently while building the minimal viable product for the donation-driven business model around custom agent developmen based on user requests.

# Contribution
BotGarage is intended to become a community. Ideally this is a place to hang out and tune bots together. If you need an example, imagine to be part of a biker gang. The garage would be something like the digital version of your clubhouse where we come together any try to come up with the best bots we can possibly imagine.

There are no rules or guidelines for how to contribute apart from making sure we get along nicely. That's it.

# Organisation
Please use the ideation repository only to phrase and discuss ideas. Once you feel like building a feature, kindly move it to a separate repository.
